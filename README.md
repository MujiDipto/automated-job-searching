# automated-job-searching
Python script that automates the job searching process at UQ StudentHub for international students.

I realised every morning I:
* grab a cup of coffee
* visit UQ StudentHub
* Login
* Set some filters
* Check if there are any new job posts

So I decided to automate the process (except the coffee) using Python.

### How to run

1. Install Selenium
   ```sh
   pip install selenium
   ```

2. Edit line 24 and 25 and write your UQ username and password.
3. Run the main.py
   ```sh
   python3 main.py
   ```
